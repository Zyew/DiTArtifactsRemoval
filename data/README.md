# Artifacts Simulation
Artifacts are generated from two reliable clinical CT datasets ([CQ500](（https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crawford/qureai-headct) for brain and [PANCREATIC-CT-CBCT-SEG](https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/collection/pancreatic-ct-cbct-seg/) for abdomen). Each CT volume is treated as a true object and projected into the sinogram domain using DiffCT. Artifacts are then simulated directly in the projection domain, and the corrupted sinograms are reconstructed to obtain artifact volumes.
